A vue-based app to trade stock.

Demo: <https://jordon-chen.github.io/Vue2.js/stock_trader/index.html>

* This app consists of 2 components:  portfolio and stocks.
* Using [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) to manage the user’s stocks.
* The [mapGetters](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/getters.html#the-mapgetters-helper) helper simply maps store getters to local computed properties.
* [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) is the official router for Vue.
* Using slide-in [animation](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_animate.asp) to provide better user experiences.
* Implemented [RWD](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) design with [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
