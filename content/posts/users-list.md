A react-based app to list users.

Demo: <http://jordon-chen.github.io/users-list>

* This app consists of 2 components: UI, User.
* Using [controlled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html#:~:text=In%20a%20controlled%20component%2C%20form,form%20values%20from%20the%20DOM.) to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component.
* [Fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
* [Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
* [Refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.
